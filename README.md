# Our Blue World
## Inspiration
Ever have a New Year's resolution that you didn't keep? We definitely have, except we now we have a solution. The app OurBlueWorld adds a sprinkle of extra motivation so more people will actively do more to saving our oceans, keeping our blue world blue. 

## What it does
The main function of OurBlueWorld is allowing you to compete with your friends or communities in sustainable ocean practices. Users input information about how much water they use, distance traveled by car, and plastic use. The app then gives them a score indicating how much they are improving marine ecosystems and shows them a leaderboard that ranks a group or organization by score. There are also comparison pages and information pages that show you how well you are doing compared to the rest of the world, and how each action you do affects marine life as a whole.

## How we built it
OurBlueWorld is based on Python and JavaScript. We use MongoDB to keep track of users and organizations, Flask to pass information between the database and user inputs, and React Native for the user interface.

## Challenges we ran into
It was a challenge for us to use our tools, because it was the first time for many of us. Along the way, there were many times where we weren't sure what to do and did not understand how things work, but eventually, we learned and overcame these issues.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of everything we learned, and coming as far as we did with our project in just a little over a day.

## What's next for OurBlueWorld
In the future, OurBlueWorld will implement more factors to consider. Other features include allowing a user to join multiple leaderboards, and a global leaderboard. There will also be more graphics and comparisons, so the user can better understand their impact and see how they are changing throughout time.
